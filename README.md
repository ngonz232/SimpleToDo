## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

A challenge was the time constraint and rapid ramp up to the tech stack. We had to get used to Github, Android Studio, and 
many other areas at the same time we were supposed to develop everything in one day.

I prioritized things in order and was able to thoroughly learn the tools we need rather than rush through them since we will need them for the future.
I was also able to complete the whole bonus activity and turn it in.
